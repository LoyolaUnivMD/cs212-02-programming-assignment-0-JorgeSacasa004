1.	Ask user for how many people will infect the virus daily and save it into variable R. (“What is the value of R?
2.	Create variable called total_cases and stablish it to 1
3.	Create a variable count and make it equal to 0
4.	While count is less than 10
    a.	If count is equal to 0
        i.	Output “0 	1.0”
        ii.	Count equals to count plus 1
    b.	Else if count is equal to 1
        i.	Output “(count value) 		(total_cases + R)”
        ii.	Count equals to count plus 1

    c.	Else
        i.	Output “(count value) 		(total_cases + (R*2)”
        ii.	Count equals to count plus 1
